## Bells and whistles

* 🪄 Magical address at `/surprise-me/`. (Like https://dahlstrand.net/surprise-me/.)
* 🎲 Every visit to the magical address redirects to a new random post.
* 💪 Flexible! Link to the magical address from anywhere: the footer, your main menu, or another website.
* 🎁 More to come! Tell me your wishes.

## Get started

Hey, fellow microblogger! 👋

This Micro.blog plug-in is still in beta. But it's a working plug-in that you can manually install and play around with. The installation will be a lot easier in the future. So bear with me for now.

### Install the plug-in

1. Sign in to https://micro.blog in your favorite browser.

2. [Follow this link](https://micro.blog/account/themes/new?plugin=1) or manually go to *Design* → *Edit Custom Themes* and press *New Plug-in*.
3. Enter a fitting *Title* (like Surprise me!).
4. Paste the following into *Clone URL*:
```
https://github.com/svendahlstrand/plugin-surprise-me
```
5. Choose which *Site* you want to install the plug-in.
6. Press *Add Plug-in*
7. Congratulations, the plug-in is installed.

### Make sure the plug-in works and start linking

Your blog should now have a magical address at `/surprise-me/`. So, for example, if your blog is at https://dahlstrand.net/, the magical address is https://dahlstrand.net/surprise-me/.

1. Make sure surfing to `/surprise-me/` redirects you to a random blog post.
2. Start linking to the magic address! You can put it anywhere a link goes: in a blog post, in your footer or menu. Or from a completely different website.

### Configure the plug-in (if you want)

TODO: Write this part. 😊
